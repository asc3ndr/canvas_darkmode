# Dark mode for Canvas

A hot mess of CSS trying to wrangle control of all the different stylesheets presented on a Canvas site. It's a work in progress that I update every once in a while when Canvas invariably break the styling, or I spot things that I've missed. 

The stylesheet has support for different themes, however this function is not implemented yet. I might implement it if I get some time to read the chrome API properly, but for now it's not a priority for me, and as such the code is presented as is for anyone who cares to tangle with it.

# Google Web Store extension
The project has been published as unlisted on Google Web Store, which means you won't find it normally, but for those who would like to give it a try here is the link:
