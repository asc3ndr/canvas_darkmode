# Dark mode for Canvas

A hot mess of CSS trying to wrangle control of all the different stylesheets presented on a Canvas site. It's a work in progress that I update every once in a while when Canvas invariably break the styling, or I spot things that I've missed. 

The stylesheet has support for different themes, however this function is not implemented yet. I might implement it if I get some time to read the chrome API properly, but for now it's not a priority for me, and as such the code is presented as is for anyone who cares to tangle with it.
